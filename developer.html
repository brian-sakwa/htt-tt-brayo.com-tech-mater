<h1>disadvantages of website</h1>
<p> The internet has disadvantages including security and privacy risks like identity theft and hacking,
 exposure to misinformation and harmful content such as fake news, violent imagery, and cyberbullying,
  and risks to physical and mental health from excessive use, leading to issues like addiction, isolation,
   reduced concentration, and eye strain. It can also cause social issues like isolation,
    reduced face-to-face interaction, and a widening digital divide</p>
<h2>importance of the website/h2>
<p>  The primary purpose of creating a website is to establish an online presence for information sharing,
 business promotion, product sales, or personal expression and to achieve specific goals like lead generation,
  brand awareness, or direct e-commerce transactions. Websites act as a digital storefront,
   a professional portfolio, or an informational hub, 
   connecting individuals and organizations with a global audience and serving as a vital tool for modern communication,
    marketing, and business growth.</P>
